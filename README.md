In this repository I implemented the clone of Scratch in React - Native, 
To run this application an android device or an android emulator is necessary.

### Some key points
In this repository
1) **App.js:** is the Starting JavaScript File that opens our application and decides which screen it is opening next here it is the MainActivity.js.
2) **MainActivity.js:** It is the playground where we have to Sprite images first one is the cat and other one is the ball sprite which are draggable.
3) **newScreen.js** It is the screen from where the actions are defined for the sprite.
